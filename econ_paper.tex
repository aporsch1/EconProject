    #TODO: I still need to decide between some sort of data science project with the virtuous circles or a cut and dry paper with the resource curse in Nigeria. I should be able to do either of these, but the virtuous circles one seems clearly more difficult,
    which is really not what I am looking for when it comes to this economics class. This is most definitely supposed to be my blowoff class. Anyway, this will get updated when I choose to actually write this mf paper.
